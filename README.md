# 🔩 MagneticCage173

**MagneticCage173** is a plugin for the game **SCP: Secret Laboratory**, built on the **EXILED** framework. It allows free movement with **SCP-173** inside a special magnetic cage, enabling its safe containment.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Look** at SCP-173.
2. **Use the command**: `.cage173`
3. SCP-173 will be locked inside a cage that prevents it from attacking.
4. You can then move freely while carrying the cage.
